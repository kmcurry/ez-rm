No one likes using CRMs. Stop feeding the beast! You shouldn't have to type, copy, paste and click all of your relationships into yet another
database just so you can "manage" them!

EZ RM is customer relationship management that just works using the relationships you already maintain.

Use EZ RM to find out what you want to know, share with others, control who shares what and 
never feed the CRM beast again.

**mail-rm**

Most of our relationships are in our email. We just need good software that knows how to make it work for us.
mail-rm does it. Mail RM uses your inbox as the relationship management database.

By analyzing your email EZ RM  will tell

Connect EZ RM to your appointment calendar and EZ RM will brief you about the last time you engaged with the other
invitees

Share EZ RM with your colleagues and EZ RM will tell you important information like who else is communicating with 
your contacts, how often and how recently.

mail-rm is just the start because of course email isn't the only place where we maintain relationships. They're also
in our phones and our social media accounts.

**mobile-rm**

Our mobile phones are the other main sources for our relationship data. If NSA is going to use that metadata you might
at well use it, too!

**social-rm**

Lots of other relationships are found in our social media. Increasingly social media are becoming a mix of personal
and professional associations. EZ RM helps you understand when and where the two intersect.

**tele-rm**

EZ RM for offices that use group teleconference and desk phone lines.

***EZ RM***

Put it all together and master your relationships like never before.

Never again should there be a CRM that requires us to put in data about our relationships.
