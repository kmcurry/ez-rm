ez-rm
=======
EZ-RM is customer relationship management (CRM) made easy. No one likes using CRM tools on the market but they are doing it anyway. We know this because people are collectively spending *billions* on CRM. Stop feeding the beast! You shouldn't have to type, copy, paste and click all of your relationships into yet another
database just so you can "manage" them! You shouldn't have to hire an expensive consultant to customize your expensive CRM before you can make the investment work for you. You deserve insight and you shouldn't have to work so hard to get it.

EZ RM is customer relationship management that just works using the relationships you already maintain.

Use EZ RM to find out what you want to know, share with others, control who shares what and 
never feed the CRM beast again.

**mail-rm**

Most of our relationships are in our email. We just need good software that knows how to make it work for us.
mail-rm does it. Mail RM uses your inbox as the relationship management database.

Connect EZ RM to your appointment calendar and EZ RM will brief you about the last time you engaged with the other
invitees

Share EZ RM with your colleagues and EZ RM will tell you important information like who else is communicating with 
your contacts, how often and how recently.

mail-rm is just the start because of course email isn't the only place where we maintain relationships. They're also
in our phones and our social media accounts.

**mobile-rm**

Our mobile phones are the other main sources for our relationship data. If NSA is going to use that metadata you might
at well use it, too!

**social-rm**

Lots of other relationships are found in our social media. Increasingly social media are becoming a mix of personal
and professional associations. EZ RM helps you understand when and where the two intersect.

**tele-rm**

EZ RM for offices that use group teleconference and desk phone lines.

***EZ RM***

Put it all together and master your relationships like never before.

Never again should we settle for CRM that requires us to labor so hard to leverage insight.

Who uses EZ-RM?
---------------
EZ-RM is used by people and organizations who feel relationship tracking is way too important and way too hard. EZ-RM is used by fundraisers, recruiters, business capture managers, brokers and sellers.

Why do people use EZ-RM?
------------------------
EZ-RM is ideal for understanding the people and relationships engaged with your business. When relationships are attached to work flows using Workflow Templates EZ-RM tracks sales funnels, customer service, membership engagement, fund raising, recruiting and more. EZ-RM is like web site analytics for your inbox and mobile phone traffic.

How does EZ-RM Work?
--------------------
EZ-RM uses your email database, phone contacts database and social media graph to answer key questions you are always trying to answer:
* Who else in my org is also communicating with Person X or Organization Y?
* When was the last time I or someone in my org communicated with Person X or Organization Y?
* What was the last thing Person X and I communicated?
* Who in my org communicates most with Person X or Organization Y?
* What organizations is my organization communicating with? Has my organization communicated with?
* And much more...

When your contacts are attached to Work Flows EZ-RM answers questions like:
* Is this contact at the start, in-process or closing out a work flow?
* When did this contact start this work flow?
* When is this contact expected to complete this work flow?
* At what step is this contact in this flow?
* What is the next step I expect this contact to reach in the flow? When?

EZ-RM uses natural language processing to extract data necessary for its algorithms, categorize contacts by topics and learn from your contact behavior.

What else does EZ-RM Do?
------------------------
We want EZ-RM to stay EZ so we'll avoid getting carried away with imagined features. One key capability of EZ-RM is the
Workflow Templates feature. Workflow Templates are customizable add-ons for common business work flows. EZ-RM does the bearish work of creating a relationships database using data you already have. Use Workflow Templates to put contacts into typical work flows like: fundraising campaign, leadership recruiting drive, new business capture and more.
