Customer Relationship Management using your inbox

Face it: no one likes using CRMs. It's silly that we should be expected to type, paste and click all the information
about our relationships into a database just so we can "manage" them. There's a reason everyone calls it "feeding the beast".

But all of our relationships are right there in our email. We just need good software that knows how to make it work for us.

mail-rm is just the start because of course email isn't the only place where we maintain relationships. They're also
in our phones and our social media accounts.

Never again should there be a CRM that requires us to put in data about our relationships.
